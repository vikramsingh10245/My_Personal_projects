Basically it was a live project -Car parking system .
In that project there is a admin which can maintain everything and can add/delete/update 
the operator
 and see all the details of the cars. he has every permission. The operator which uses this software is basically do these things:-
1.The operator first checks whether there are slots available or not is available it books 
the slot for the customer and there are 3 floors
 so if the slots are available its shown in green and if its booked it shows red color.

2.When the customer come the operator just had to enter the car number and select the 
slot for the car and details will be automatically be filled 
like floor no, slot, date, time.

3.And when the customer goes out the operator just had to enter the car number and 
checkout time will be automatically be entered in the database.

4.The operator can also check the recent booked slots and as well as current date parking 
And about when the operator forget his/her password he can reset it by entering date of joining and his pet name.
