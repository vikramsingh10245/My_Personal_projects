                                     <p><b>Answer 2:</b>   Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory illness that can spread from person to person. There are many types of human coronaviruses, including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses. COVID-19 is a new disease, caused by a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans. Current symptoms reported for patients with COVID-19 have included mild to severe respiratory illness with cough, and shortness of breath or difficulty breathing; or at least two of these symptoms: fever, chills, repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, or a new loss of taste or smell. You may have other symptoms. Talk to your health care provider if you have questions or concerns about symptoms..</p>

                                     <p><b>Answer 4:</b>  The best way to prevent the spread of infections and decrease the risk of getting sick is by washing your hands with plain soap and water, advises the CDC. Washing hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds is essential, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after coughing, sneezing, or blowing oneâ€™s nose. If soap and water are not available, CDC recommends consumers use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. <br>
