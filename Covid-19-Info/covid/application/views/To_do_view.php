                           <span><b>1.</b>&nbsp; Cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.<br>
                                 <b>2.</b>&nbsp; Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.<br>
                                 <b>3.</b>&nbsp; If you’re speaking, and you put a couple of layers of cotton or paper towel in front of your mouth, the droplets go into that and not into the face of the person you’re speaking to. That’s why masks dramatically help reduce the spread of the virus.<br>
                                 <b>4.</b>&nbsp; If the WHO were to consider modifying their current recommendations, they might go in the direction of saying: <br>
                                 “Save the surgical masks for the healthcare settings, and let’s look into using homemade masks and cloth masks in the community to reduce transmission.”<br>
                                 <b>5.&nbsp;</b>Cover the mouth, the nose, and the chin. Don’t touch the front of the mask because it might be contaminated.</span>

                           <span>To protect yourself and others against COVID-19, clean your hands frequently and thoroughly. Use alcohol-based hand sanitizer or wash your hands with soap and water. If you use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, make sure you use and store it carefully.<br>

                          <b>1.</b>&nbsp;Keep alcohol-based hand sanitizers out of children’s reach. Teach them how to apply the sanitizer and monitor its use.<br>
                          <b>2.</b>&nbsp;Apply a coin-sized amount on your hands. <br>
                          <b>3.</b>&nbsp;Avoid touching your eyes, mouth and nose immediately after using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, as it can cause irritation.<br>
                          <b>4.</b>&nbsp;Under no circumstance, drink or let children swallow an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. It can be poisonous. <br>
                          <b>5.</b>&nbsp;Remember that washing your hands with soap and water is also effective against COVID-19. </span>

                                  Have someone bring you supplies. If you need to leave your house, wear a mask to avoid infecting others.<br>

                                    <b>3.</b>&nbsp;If you stayed at home for 14 days because you live with someone who had symptoms, you can return to your usual activities on the 15th day as long as you have no symptoms.<br></span>
